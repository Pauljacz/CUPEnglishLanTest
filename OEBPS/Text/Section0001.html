        <span class="callout_row_data noborder"><em>Petra Ecclestone’s account of life not being easy when you are rich is not very persuasive because you keep wanting to point out to her that she takes for granted more luxury than she is aware of. For example, she casually mentions having ‘beauty salons’ in her house. Note the plural! She doesn’t have a dog – she has seven dogs, and she doesn’t just have a posh car, she has a Range Rover (Not a cheap car) for running around, and a matching ‘white’ Ferrari and Rolls Royce. And just to top it, her husband has a ‘black’ Lamborghini and Rolls Royce. That’s six cars between them! The trouble with Petra Ecclestone is she doesn’t have a clue about the real world. She thinks she’s done the US a favour by paying tax when she bought her mansion and she thinks she’s doing people in Croatia a favour by giving them her ‘old’ clothes. This favour is because she thinks ‘old’ clothes are old after a few weeks so she wants to get rid of them.</em></span>
